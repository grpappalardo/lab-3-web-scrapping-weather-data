This script scrapes the National Weather Service's website to print weather data on a U.S. location given its latitude and longitude. It does this with BeautifulSoup, by concatenating the URL for the latitude/longitude, checking and printing this URL, using get() to find and hold the URL, then creating an object with BeautifulSoup and viewing the information on the webpage with .content and the html_parser. From there, the specific element on the page (found via Inspect in the browser and find()) is found and .text is used to extract. This text is printed.
I did not have any major issues working on this script. The use of latitude/longitude means there can be a variation of weather outputs from adjacent locales, as long as there are multiple weather information collecting stations in the region.
